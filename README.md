# Obsidian Slytherin
This is an [Osidian.md](https://obsidian.md/) theme inspired on Slytherin colors from Harry Potter series.

## Features
The core css uses Minimal theme from the amazing css stylist Kepano, who did an awesome job with the original theme, I added some of the features below to fit my tastes:
- Folder icons.
- Darker icons with fading UI.
- Bigger headers.
- Tables with different style for better visualization.

## Disclaimer
> This theme modifies significant parts of the Obsidian interface, so it might break with future updates. It may also be incompatible with other bits of custom CSS you have. The theme file is organized in such a way that you can comment out sections that may be causing conflicts. - Kepano
